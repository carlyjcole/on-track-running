# on track: a running app
## Hi there!

This is a simple running app that I made for my personal use. I added some features that I wanted in the apps that I use—year-by-year statistics, shoe mileage tracking, heart rate analyses, and even a section which tells me how much of the circumference of the earth I’ve run. As of now, it works only for my statistics due to limitations placed by Strava and their API. In the future I’d like to expand it so others can use it.
